!2 Comcast Sample Fixture Review Checklist

Copy this checklist into each wiki page user story that supports a new test fixture and mark whether each checklist item for the test passes or fails. If any 
item(s) in the checklist are marked fail, include the reason for the failure and suggestions on how to remedy the failure. Discuss the failures in a meeting 
between developer and reviewer and agree on the remediation action. Either the developer or reviewer can make the changes to the test - as long as they follow 
the agreed remedy. Once all items in the checklist have passed, user stories can move from Review column to the Test Column on the Kanban Board.
